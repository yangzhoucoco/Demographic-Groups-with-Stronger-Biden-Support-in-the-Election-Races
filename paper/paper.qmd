# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}

For the actual data we can use the 2020 Cooperative Election Study (CES) (@main_data)
```{r}
#| label: fig-vote
#| fig-cap: The distribution of presidential preferences, by gender, and highest education
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ces2020 <- read_csv(here("data/analysis_data/analysis_data.csv"))

ces2020 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = education, fill = voted_for)) +
  stat_count(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(gender)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Highest education",
    y = "Number of respondents",
    fill = "Voted for"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```



Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)


Talk way more about it. 



# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ is the political preference of the respondent and equal to 1 if Biden and 0 if Trump. Then $\mbox{gender}_i$ is the gender of the respondent and $\mbox{education}_i$ is the education of the respondent.  
We could estimate the parameters using `stan_glm()`. Note that the model is a generally accepted short-hand.  In practice rstanarm converts categorical variables into a series of indicator variables and there are multiple coefficients estimated. In the interest of run-time we will randomly sample 1,000 observations and fit the model on that, rather than the full dataset.

#linear regression example
\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}


#logistic regression example
\begin{align} 
y_i|\pi_i &\sim \mbox{Bern}(\pi_i) \\
\mbox{logit}(\pi_i) & = \beta_0+\beta_1 \times\mbox{gender}_i +\beta_2 \times \mbox{education}_i\\
\beta_0 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_1 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_2 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0. 2.5)
\end{align}


We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm, `here` package of @here and `model_summary` package of @model_summary, we use the default priors from `rstanarm`


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.


# Results

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(rstanarm)

first_model <-
  readRDS(file = here::here("model/first_model.rds"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: tbl-modelresults
#| tbl-cap: "Explanatory models of flight time based on wing width and wing length"
#| warning: false

modelsummary::modelsummary(
  list(
    "Support Biden" = us_political_preferences
  ),
  statistic = "mad",
  fmt = 2
)
```




# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.

## Posterior predictive check

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-1 we implement a posterior predictive check. This shows...

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-2 we compare the posterior with the prior. This shows...
